I am a final year PhD Candidate at the Business Analytics Section, Amsterdam Business School, University of Amsterdam. I am jointly supervised by [Dr. Chintan Amrit](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/a/m/c.amrit/c.amrit.html) and [Prof. Joaquim Gromicho](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/g/r/j.a.s.gromicho/j.a.s.gromicho.html).

Prior to joining the University of Amsterdam, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. 

# Research 

My main research interests lie at the intersection of Operations Management (OM) and Information Systems (IS). My PhD thesis explores the role of *domain intelligence* in predictive and prescriptive analytics with a focus on humanitarian analytics, routing, logistics and supply chain operations. I am also interested in Explainable AI (XAI), combining predictive and prescriptive analytical capabilities, and designing decision support systems. I am passionate about applying data-driven analytics and AI to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
